abstract: In this paper we evaluate public sentiment and opinion on Brexit
  during September and October 2019 by collecting over 16 million user messages
  from Twitter - world’s largest online micro-blogging service. We perform
  sentiment analysis using the Python VADER library, and topic modeling using
  Latent Dirichlet Allocation function of the gensim library. Through sentiment
  analysis, we quantify daily public sentiment towards Brexit and use it to
  evaluate Brexit’s impact on the British currency exchange rate and stock
  markets in Britain. With the aid of topic modeling, we discover the most
  popular daily topics of discussion on Twitter using the keyword ”Brexit”. Some
  of our findings include the discovery of positive correlation between Twitter
  sentiment towards Brexit and British pound sterling exchange rate. We also
  found daily discussion topics on Twitter, identified through unsupervised
  machine learning to be a good proxy of important current events related with
  Brexit.
